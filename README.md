This workspace contains three folders
1) code -> code for training the model, calculate IoU matching, and calculate ensemble of two camera angles compared with single camera
2) data -> dataset for each camera angle and type of detection (behavior, identity), video data for testing the model, and ground truth behavior label based on human observation
3) model -> model for each camera angle and type of detection (behavior, identity)
Each folder has the readme.txt file that explains each file in that folder in details
